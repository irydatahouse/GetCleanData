# Code Book

This code book describes the data transformations conducted on the `UCI HAR Dataset`
for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
